    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pizza crust recipe was given to me by a friend. It is quick, easy, and delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Active dry yeast</li>
        <li>Warm water</li>
        <li>Bread flour</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in a mixing bowl; stir well to combine. Beat until a stiff dough has formed. Cover the bowl; let rise at room temperature until dough doubles in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a thin crust. Cover with your favorite sauce and toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake pizza in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
